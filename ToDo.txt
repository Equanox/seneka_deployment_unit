ToDo's:

Open Pull-Requests (to be accepted for ipa320 by ipa-goa/ipa-rmb/ipa-jsf):
cob_perception_common
cob_object_perception

Overall:
- expose hardcoded parameters (e.g. camera pose, gripper length, ...) as parameters


seneka_sensornode_detection:
- at the moment, only one marker (id1) is used for finding the pose of the node. All markers should be detected and an interpolation between the poses made (slerp, possibly in quaternion class)
- create own fiducial launch file and yamls?
- check how the rotation of the markers is specified (rpy like on Wikipedia)
- there are still some .cpp files left from Equanox' thesis that are not integrated. Check if they should be integrated/kept or can be discarded.

seneka_msgs:
- either remove or rename (not used atm)
